b1;
TID:1,operation:b,dataItem:null
Begin T1: Record is added to transaction table with Tid=1 and TS(T1)=1. T1 state=Active

r1(Y);
TID:1,operation:r,dataItem:Y
Y read locked by T1: Lock table record for Y is created with mode R (T1 holds lock).

w1(Y);
TID:1,operation:w,dataItem:Y
Read lock upgraded to write lock for item Y by T1, lock table updated to mode W

r1(Z);
TID:1,operation:r,dataItem:Z
Z read locked by T1: Lock table record for Z is created with mode R (T1 holds lock).

b2;
TID:2,operation:b,dataItem:Z
Begin T2: Record is added to transaction table with Tid=2 and TS(T2)=2. T2 state=Active

r2(Y);
TID:2,operation:r,dataItem:Y
Write Read conflict between T2 and T1
T2 is aborted and releases Write lock from item Y
Transaction T1 has been appended to readlock list for data item Y. So, it has acquired 'Read Lock' on Y

b3;
TID:3,operation:b,dataItem:Y
Begin T3: Record is added to transaction table with Tid=3 and TS(T3)=3. T3 state=Active

r3(Z);
TID:3,operation:r,dataItem:Z
Z read locked by T3: Lock table record for Z is updated (T1, T3 hold R lock on Z)

w1(Z);
TID:1,operation:w,dataItem:Z
Read Write conflict between T1 and multiple Transactions in readlock list
T1 'BLOCKED'
Transaction T1 is blocked and this operation has been added to waiting list. T1 is waiting

e1;
TID:1,operation:e,dataItem:Z
Transaction T1 is already BLOCKED
Transaction T1 is blocked and its 'End' operation has been added to its waiting list. T1 is waiting

w3(Z);
TID:3,operation:w,dataItem:Z
Read Write conflict between T3 and multiple Transactions in readlock list
T3 is aborted and releases Read lock from item Z
Transaction T1 is unblocked
Transaction T1 has been granted 'Write Lock' for data item Z
Transaction T1 is committed and all the locks are released.
Transaction T1 has been granted 'Write Lock' for data item Z

e3;
TID:3,operation:e,dataItem:Z
Transaction T3 is already aborted

e2;
TID:2,operation:e,dataItem:Z
Transaction T2 is already aborted
